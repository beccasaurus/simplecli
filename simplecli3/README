OK

we've got V1 - the regular old SimpleCLI

we've got a bit of DSL prototyping in SimpleCLI2

here, I'm going to:
 * re-implement the simple DSL-less version
 * add the DSL on top of it
 * make sure it's backwards compatible
 * overwrite SimpleCLI with SimpleCLI2 & deploy  :)

reminder: KEEP IT SIMPLE!
